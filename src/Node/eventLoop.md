 It enables non-blocking I/O operations and allows Node.js to handle many concurrent connections without the need for multithreading. Here's a detailed explanation of the Node.js event loop:

### 1. Single-Threaded, Non-Blocking I/O:

Node.js is designed to be single-threaded and asynchronous, utilizing an event-driven architecture. This means that the main thread (event loop) is responsible for handling events and executing callbacks. Instead of blocking on I/O operations (like reading from a file or making a network request), Node.js uses asynchronous operations to continue processing other tasks while waiting for I/O to complete.

### 2. Event Loop Components:

- **Event Loop:** The event loop is the heart of Node.js. It constantly checks the message queue for events and executes associated callbacks. It keeps the application running and responsive.

- **Callback Queue (Message Queue):** Asynchronous operations produce events that are placed in the callback queue. The event loop checks this queue for pending events and processes them one by one.

- **Call Stack:** The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the function calls in the program. When a function is called, it is added to the stack, and when it completes, it is removed from the stack. Here all the execution happens

- **Node APIs (C++ bindings):** Certain operations (e.g., file I/O, network requests) are handled by the Node APIs, which delegate work to the underlying system. These operations are non-blocking and use callbacks to signal completion.

### 3. Event Loop Phases:

The event loop operates in phases, and each phase has a specific set of tasks to perform:

- **Timers:** Executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.

- **Pending Callbacks:** Executes I/O-related callbacks deferred by the system.

- **Idle, Prepare:** Internal phases with system-specific tasks.

- **Poll:** Retrieves new I/O events from the event queue and executes their callbacks. If no events are present, it waits for events.

- **Check:** Executes `setImmediate` callbacks.

- **Close Callbacks:** Executes `close` event callbacks, such as `socket.on('close', ...)`.

### 5. Microtasks and Macrotasks:

- **Microtasks:** Microtasks are tasks with higher priority than macrotasks. Promises and `process.nextTick` are examples of microtasks. Microtasks are executed after each phase of the event loop.

- **Macrotasks:** Macrotasks include timers, I/O events, and setImmediate callbacks. They are executed in specific event loop phases.

### 6. Process.nextTick():

`process.nextTick` is a special function that defers a callback to the beginning of the next event loop iteration. It is often used to schedule callbacks that need to be executed before I/O events.

### 7. WebAPIs
Overall, Web APIs are an essential part of the Node.js event loop. They allow Node.js applications to perform asynchronous operations without blocking the main thread, which is important for maintaining responsiveness.
Here are some examples of Web APIs that are commonly used in Node.js applications:
The fs module provides an API for interacting with the filesystem.
The http module provides an API for making HTTP requests and responses.
The net module provides an API for creating and managing TCP and UDP sockets.
The child_process module provides an API for spawning child processes.
setTimeout is part of WebAPI the callback function moved to callback queue and executed

### 8. Promises
 Promise is native in ES6 and it will be moved to Job queue which has high priority than callback queue in the execution order
