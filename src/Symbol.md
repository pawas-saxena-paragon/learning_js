In JavaScript, a `Symbol` is a primitive data type introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that represents a unique identifier. Unlike other primitive types (such as strings or numbers), symbols are guaranteed to be unique, and they can be used as keys in object properties. Symbols are often used to create "hidden" or "private" properties in objects.

Here's an overview of the key characteristics and uses of symbols in JavaScript:

### Creating Symbols:

You can create a symbol using the `Symbol` function. Each call to `Symbol()` returns a new, unique symbol:

```javascript
const mySymbol = Symbol();
const anotherSymbol = Symbol();
console.log(mySymbol === anotherSymbol); // Outputs: false (symbols are unique)
```

### Using Symbols as Object Keys:

One common use of symbols is as keys for object properties. Since symbols are unique, they help avoid naming conflicts in objects:

```javascript
const mySymbol = Symbol('mySymbol');

const myObject = {
  [mySymbol]: 'Hello, Symbol!'
};

console.log(myObject[mySymbol]); // Outputs: Hello, Symbol!
```

### Well-Known Symbols:

ES6 introduced a set of well-known symbols that have specific meanings in certain contexts. For example:

- `Symbol.iterator`: Used to make an object iterable.
- `Symbol.toStringTag`: Specifies the default description of an object.
- `Symbol.species`: Used in constructor functions to create derived objects.

```javascript
const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
const iterator = myArray[Symbol.iterator]();

console.log(iterator.next()); // Outputs: { value: 1, done: false }
```

### Symbol Properties and Methods:

Symbols have properties and methods associated with them:

- `Symbol.for(key)`: Returns a symbol with the given key. If the symbol with that key does not exist, it creates a new one.
- `Symbol.keyFor(sym)`: Returns the key for a symbol registered with `Symbol.for`.

```javascript
const globalSymbol = Symbol.for('globalSymbol');
console.log(Symbol.keyFor(globalSymbol)); // Outputs: globalSymbol
```

### Use Cases:

1. **Object Property Keys:**
   Symbols are often used as unique keys for object properties, especially in scenarios where you want to avoid naming conflicts.

2. **Private Properties:**
   Symbols are sometimes used to create private properties in objects, as they are not exposed through typical reflection techniques.

3. **Well-Known Symbols:**
   Well-known symbols are used to customize the behavior of objects in certain JavaScript features, such as iteration and string conversion.

It's important to note that symbols are not enumerable, meaning they won't appear in `for...in` loops or standard `Object.keys` iterations. This makes them suitable for scenarios where you want to keep certain properties "hidden" or less likely to be accidentally accessed or modified.
